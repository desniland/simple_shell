# Simple Shell

This is a basic implementation of a shell in C, providing a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system.

## Features

- **Command Execution:** Executes commands entered by the user.
- **Built-in Commands:** Supports a few built-in commands such as `cd`, `exit`, and `help`.
- **Simple Syntax:** Follows a basic shell syntax for command execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Unix-like operating system

### Building the Shell

```bash
gcc shell.c -o shell
```

### Running the Shell

```bash
./shell
```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can enter commands as you would in a regular terminal. Some examples:

```bash
$ ls
$ cd /path/to/directory
$ echo "Hello, Shell!"
$ exit
```

For a list of built-in commands and their usage, you can use the `help` command.
